# JavaScript 101 Quiz

>  ** Note:** The names of variables are up to you

1. Clone this repository into your `/vagrant/quizzes` directory.
2. Create an `index.html` file and a `quiz.js` file and link them up.
3. Add the following code to your HTML file's `<body>` tag.

```html
<article>
  <section id="fruit-list"></section>
</article>
```

## Your mission:

1. Create a variable that is an empty string.
2. Create a variable that holds an empty array.
3. Create a variable that holds the value of 2.
4. Add the names of ten fruits to the array. Make sure some of the fruits have the letter 'a' in them.
5. Set up code to loop over every other item in your array of fruits.
6. Inside the loop, check if there is the letter 'a' in the name of the current fruit.
7. If there is an 'a' anywhere in the current fruit name, then replace it with an 'e'.
8. Add the new name of the fruit to the variable that was initially set up as an empty string (see step 1).
9. Update the contents of the `fruit-list` DOM element with the new fruit name. Each fruit should be displayed as a block-level element type.
11. Each block-level element that contains a fruit name should have a background color (of your choice) applied to it.
12. The entire fruit list should have a 1px border around it (not each one individually).
13. The first fruit's name should be bold text.
14. The last fruit's text should be `20px` in size and the entire element should have a different background color.
